## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle weight is unlikely to give a random variance as it is below 0.05.
The vehicle weight is very small and should be considered to have a zero slope.
Yes, the r squared value shows that it is a good model of prediction.

Yes, the variance is less than the maximum of 100 pounds so it meets the design specifications.
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
![One sample t test](https://github.com/rindneremily/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/One%20sample%20t%20test.png)
This tested the null mean equaling 1500 and the altnerative not equaling 1500. The 95% CI shows that it is between 1497.507 and 1500.053.
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
I would perform another multiple linear regression to compare fuel efficiency, average miles driven per month of the consumer, and safety rating. All of this data needs to be quantifiable so I would use miles per gallon, miles driven per month, and a rating out of ten. The null would be that the majority of the population want 30mpg+ in the city, drive 1,000+ miles per month, and want a safety rating 6+. The alternative would be less than 30mpg in the city, drive less than 1000 miles per month, and want a safety rating below 6.
